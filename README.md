Note:
1. We commented out the install package line and in order to run this code you will have to install those R-packages first
2. We attempted to fix the evaluation matrix but the result is still a bit off. However, running CRF and dictionary file directly will give you the score.

  
  Files
  - /Code/
  1. Dictionary.R train and evaluate the traditionary method
  2. CRF.R train and evaluate the CRF model.
